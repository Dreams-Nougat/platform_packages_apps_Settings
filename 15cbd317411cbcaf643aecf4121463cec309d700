Unset (-1) is a valid state that needs to be preserved.  It means the user hasn't made a choice yet. It's required so that we may prompt the user when they enable Accessibility. 

See comment in ToggleAccessibilityServicePreferenceFragment:

// The user confirmed that they accept weaker encryption when

// enabling the accessibility service, so change encryption.

// Since we came here asynchronously, check encryption again.
