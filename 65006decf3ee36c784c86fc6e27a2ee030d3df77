This should be in onPause() instead. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html

Sorry, but calling finish() is the wrong way to do this.  Instead, move this code into SecuritySettings and disable the setting that launches this one. It looks like there's code that already does this. :/

For the following case, do you see any other option other than using finish

1. Current UI shown is Menu->Settings->Security->Set up SIM card lock(SIM card lock Settings)
2. Remove the SIM

Currently, a dialog will be shown to restart the device. But user can ignore this dialog.

SIM card lock settings screen will still be shown when there is no SIM. 

Even if we move the handling to SecuritySettings, when the user is in SIM card lock Settings(step 1 above), SecuritySettings will be in paused state and it will not be able to receive SIM state/service change broadcast information. So, it can remove or disable the preference.

Also may I know why calling finish is bad? Currently, finish has been used in many places.

I don't think this change is of much use if we can't guarantee the device is in a usable state. IIRC that's why the dialog is there.  I don't think most devices handle this well and the user experience will vary. 

Calling finish() for an asynchronous event like SIM state changes is bad because it's a very startling and potentially aggravating user experience.  Having a dialog or screen disappear while you're reading/interacting with it is a very bad experience.
