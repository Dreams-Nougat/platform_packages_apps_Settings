"so you can safely remove it" still seems relevant in this message.

None of the usb_* strings should have a 'product="default"' attribute, since they shouldn't change based on a phone/tablet/nosdcard.

This phrase is not fully relevant for USB mass storage devices connected to the Android device, since we don't support storing apps on them.  I think we're fine without a confirmation dialog.

Please don't try determining this by scraping the description.  If you want to support USB mass storage, we should be adding first-class support to the StorageVolume object.

In addition, we should build out support for n simultaneous USB mass storage devices, not just one.

For the moment we have a fixed number of USB mass storage devices we can use, 4. We add this in fstab and storage_list.xml for vold and MountService. We can detect an USB storage event in vlod or MountService, but we have to scrap the description or path. We can add a field in StorageVolume, but we prefered not to modify the class.

For the support of n simultaneous USB mass storage devices, we managed to create volumes dynamically based on netlink events, and add volumes if there are not found, also add sdcard services for each. We also modified MountService to create StorageVolume based on messages from vold. But for the moment we don't think that this is a reliable modification.
