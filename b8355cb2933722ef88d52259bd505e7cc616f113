the description of this should be better - why does the BroadcastReceiver need to be registered?  How does that prevent the crash?

why can't you just finish() and return here?

finish(); return; will still trigger the crash as onDestroy() tries to unregisterReceiver(mReceiver) which is not registered yet. In the next patch, I will a new flag that tracks whether mReceiver is registered. I could use a try-catch statement, but unregisterReceiver throws multiple IllegalArgument exception and I want to avoid string comparison.

Will it really? I guess the two lines on lines 105 and 112 are an issue too. Will those cases cause a crash as well?  This other solution seems more reasonable.

Yes, line 105 and 112 would also cause the crash. The flag should solve this problem.
