I have to submit this internally as we're adding a new public api, so you don't have to make changes to this change.

However, I think we should probably set to "" here - the full IMSI is certainly not the right answer and the user probably doesn't know what the right mix of digits and '*' wildcards is.  I don't think we know either, so I think we should show nothing.  What do you think?

I agree with you. How about use just "*", instead of nothing?

Good idea.  I'll do that.  Thx!
