I am perplex at this. The user dictionary is a fundamental part of the system and it *must* contain a LOCALE column as far as I'm aware; I don't see how the bug that you are trying to fix could happen on a compliant device. If the device does not have a LOCALE column in the user dictionary, it won't work as expected with most IMEs and should be fixed.

In which cases do you see this happen?

Of course I haven't seen this case in the user dictionary.
As I know, this is only happened by programming mistakes(when the wrong(or not exist) column is explicitly specified).
But if the columnIndex is -1, cusor.getString(columnIndex) makes IllegalStatementException.
So, I think this is must be checked -1 or not like cursor.
