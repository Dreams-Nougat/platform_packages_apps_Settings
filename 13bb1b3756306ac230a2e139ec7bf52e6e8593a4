I am perplex at this. The user dictionary is a fundamental part of the system and it *must* contain a LOCALE column as far as I'm aware; I don't see how the bug that you are trying to fix could happen on a compliant device. If the device does not have a LOCALE column in the user dictionary, it won't work as expected with most IMEs and should be fixed.

In which cases do you see this happen?
