Can you please move this check right before showing the dialog. Now we will be checking this even if we already shown the dialog and the user clicked OK?

I think it's a good way that we don't show the dialog if no market installed, of cause I considered it when I fixed this issue.

Otherwise, user maybe confused with why anything happened after clicked OK and we also can show the tip dialog in time if user installed a 3rd party market manually later.

What do you think about?
