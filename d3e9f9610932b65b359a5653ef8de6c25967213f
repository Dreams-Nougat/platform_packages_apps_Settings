If it is just a marker, can it be a better marker, like "use_default" or something that doesn't imply a valid size?

Or how about having a constant for the default value instead of hardcoding "65536" below? Then you could just set the default value here.

I rationalized this with the following thoughts.

This marker is in a series of translatable strings. We are setting policy here that the smallest log buffer size we will set is 65536. Problem is I would be tempted to use it above in defaultLogdSizeValue which is a separate policy that is written to match what logd actually has built-in. Abstracting them into values above (1000 lines above no less) bothers me, I feel like I want these close at hand.

Sorry, I was looking at the old PS where these comments live. Looks good now.

Is the marker checked anywhere? What is it for?

Marker is checked  on line 1300 and reset in line 1264. It is part of the set of translatable strings inside the xml files where the menu selection for "Off" reports back 32768. The check occurs in the layers of window management code and partly in the fragment at 1286-1292.

There are two lists that are being checked, one is the values (which 32768 is a member of) and the other is the titles (which "Off", "64K" to "16M" are a member of).

So "32768" means "Off"? Wouldn't it be better to define it as a constant then so in the code (eg line 1280) it looks like:

  currentValue = LOG_SIZE_VALUE_OFF;

SELECT_LOGD_OFF_SIZE_MARKER_VALUE

is what I chose (SELECT_LOGD to associate it with this code, OFF to tell me what it means, and SIZE to tell me what units it is describing, MARKER to tell me it is a marker and not to be repeated in the legitimate set, and VALUE to tell me it is).

I could be convinced to change MARKER to UNIQUE if you twist my rubber arm.

I just don't like "32768" being magical and requiring comments to tell me so. I vote for getting rid of this comment and using a constant above to set "32768".

Twist.

Please look at the latest PS, I am now confused by your comment.

Probably easier to use the String.replace method

Thanks, Java readability in reviewer just taught me something! This totally changes the form of this area of code to something far simpler.
